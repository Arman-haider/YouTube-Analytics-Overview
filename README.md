# Key Insights

The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of YouTube channel performance, including views, likes, comments, and video-level engagement metrics.

Analysis reveals a strong correlation between viewer engagement (likes & comments) and overall video visibility, indicating that engagement plays a crucial role in content reach.

Videos with higher consistency in uploads tend to show better average performance, highlighting the importance of regular content publishing.

SQL-based analysis enables efficient querying of large datasets, making it easier to identify top-performing videos, trends over time, and engagement patterns.

The insights derived from this data can help content creators and analysts make data-driven decisions regarding content strategy, audience targeting, and performance optimization.

This project demonstrates practical usage of CSV data processing and SQL queries for real-world analytics use cases.
